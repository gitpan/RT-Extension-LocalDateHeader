NAME
    RT-Extension-LocalDateHeader - Display local date for attachment Date
    header

DESCRIPTION
    The Date: header included in emails received by RT will often be in the
    sender's timezone (or possibly forced to UTC by the remote mail server).
    This extension will rewrite the Date: header to the user's timezone
    while also displaying the original Date: next to it. This reduces
    confusion when RT lists "Correspondence added" in the user's timezone
    but the Date header looks totally different. Most non- technical users
    don't know how to interpret the -0000 or -0400 syntax of mail Date:
    headers.

RT VERSION
    Compatible with RT 4.0 and 4.2.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions
