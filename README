NAME
    RT-Extension-LocalDateHeader - Display local date for attachment Date
    header

DESCRIPTION
    The Date: header included in emails received by RT will often be in the
    sender's timezone (or possibly forced to UTC by the remote mail server).
    This extension will rewrite the Date: header to the user's timezone
    while also displaying the original Date: next to it. This reduces
    confusion when RT lists "Correspondence added" in the user's timezone
    but the Date header looks totally different. Most non- technical users
    don't know how to interpret the -0000 or -0400 syntax of mail Date:
    headers.

VERSION
    Compatible with RT 4.0 and 4.2. Versions earlier than 4.0.8 will need to
    patch as instructed below. Untested on 3.8.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

        For earlier releases of RT 4, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::LocalDateHeader));
